# dotfiles
Hello there, welcome to my dotfiles github page. Now before getting started, don't copy the configs directly as they may contain applications that might not be installed on your linux.

# Why this config?
I found this config to be relatively more on the functional side, as you can see my idea isn't about creating the most aesthetically pleasing i3wm but a functional one. I will incorporate good functions that makes sense to be used whether integrated with i3blocks or i3. 

The apps I have installed are for my workflow, but you can install the packages that you need only. In case there is a line that is added for a specific script or application that is not installed on your machine for your specific reasons, remove it from the i3-config.

# ENJOY!
